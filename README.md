# Quantum Icebreaker: Core Workspace

Welcome to the central repository for the **Quantum Icebreaker** research initiative. This is a private workspace for the core crew, designed for collaboration on the theoretical, practical, and organizational aspects of our project.

## ðŸš€ About the Project

**Quantum Icebreaker** is an open, international research expedition aimed at exploring the nature of reality and the observer's role in its actualization. Our key hypothesis is that reality is not a static collection of objects, but a dynamic, participatory process that can be described as a "programmable interface."

This repository serves as our main "headquarters" for transitioning from a philosophical concept to a falsifiable scientific experiment.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

This monorepo contains all the key components of the project:

* **/docs:** This is where the foundational theoretical documents are stored.
    * **Manifesto:** The full version, outlining the philosophical and mathematical foundation of our model.
    * **Guide:** A practical document describing the methodology and ethics of the collective experiments.
* **/experiment-krystall:** Source code and materials for our pilot experiment, "Krystall." The goal of the experiment is to test whether coherent collective attention can introduce measurable order into a chaotic digital system.
* **/website:** Source files for our official website.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus

At this stage, our primary task is the collaborative refinement of the "Krystall" experiment protocol to ensure it is methodologically sound and ready for launch.

All discussions on specific tasks are held in the **[Issues](https://github.com/quanticebreaker-lab/Quantum-Icebreaker-Core/issues)** tab.

Thank you for being with us on this expedition!
